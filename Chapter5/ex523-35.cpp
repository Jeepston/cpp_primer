/*
Exercise 5.23: Write a program that reads two integers from the standard input
and prints the result of dividing the first number by the second.

Exercise 5.24: Revise your program to throw an exception if the second number
is zero. Test your program with a zero input to see what happens on your
system if you donâ€™t catch an exception.

Exercise 5.25: Revise your program from the previous exercise to use a try
block to catch the exception. The catch clause should print a message to the
user and ask them to supply a new number and repeat the code inside the try.
